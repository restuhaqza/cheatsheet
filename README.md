# A curated of my "Cheatsheet"

Hello everyone, Sometimes when you study something it could be more complicated about the theory/practical and you need to keep what you understand as summary/notes or whatever you call it. I called as a "Cheatsheet". You can access my notes here. Enjoy to explore. Thanks
